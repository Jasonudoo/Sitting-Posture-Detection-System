# Sitting-Posture-Detection-System
Sitting posture detection is helpful for preventing musculoskeletal disorders.With the development of motion-sensing camera and relative software development kit(SDK),it is possible to implement an application using skeleton detecting technology.In this project, we excoriated Skeleton thinning algorithm and Averaging process to detect sitting posture from a lateral view without disturbing the user.The results show this method has high accuracy when detecting improper sitting postures.
